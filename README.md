# RoadMap
Performance based Attribution crediting, weighting, cross reference system.
--

Topic Specific Granted Access level crowd source attribution system.

Target Goal:
Identify sources, dissemination, and congruence of media concepts & contribution to knowledge refinement & curation.

Deployment via Browser Extensions & Controlled Environment Access.

Weighting base: cross reference user data points on genres & hierarchies of contribution types.
